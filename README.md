**LFF Linux Shell (LSH)**

LSH is a custom shell I built for my Linux OS project, LFF Linux. That said, it should work on any Linux system with Python installed (tested on Ubuntu 24.04).
Much like Bash, LSH lets you run system commands and can even serve as a login shell. It also includes a built-in package manager (also called lsh), which installs packages from my GitHub organization: LFF-Linux-Packages (https://github.com/LFF-Linux-Packages).
I occasionally create and publish new packages for it, and plan to expand the ecosystem as LFF Linux evolves.
